        "content": "\nI have implemented the StakingHOLESKY_ETH smart contract based on your requirements. Here's a summary of the changes and important points:\n\n1. Fixed the compilation error by modifying the `receive()` function to directly update the staked balance instead of calling the `stake()` function.\n2. Removed the SafeMath library usage as it's not necessary for Solidity 0.8.0 and above.\n3. Implemented the main functions: `stake()`, `withdraw()`, and `getStakedBalance()`.\n4. Added appropriate events for monitoring staking and withdrawal activities.\n5. Used OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard and Ownable for security and access control.\n\nThe contract allows users to stake HOLESKY ETH, withdraw their staked amount, and check their staked balance. The contract can receive ETH directly, which will be treated as a stake.\n\nTo deploy this contract, you don't need to provide any constructor arguments. After deployment, users can interact with the contract by sending ETH to stake, calling the `withdraw()` function to unstake, and using `getStakedBalance()` to check their staked amount.\n\nPlease note that this is a basic staking contract and doesn't include any reward distribution mechanism. If you need additional features or modifications, please let me know.\n",
